Image Encryption and Decryption Android App
This Android app allows you to encrypt and decrypt images using a security key. The app uses bitwise XOR operation with the hash code of the security key to perform encryption and decryption on the pixel values of the selected images. Encrypted images can be saved to the device's gallery.
Features
•	Choose an image from the gallery to encrypt or decrypt.
•	Encrypt an image using a security key.
•	Decrypt an already encrypted image using the same security key.
•	Save encrypted images to the device's gallery.
